   ```

### Submitting Changes

2. Test your changes thoroughly and verify no broken links with pre-comit checker.
3. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

`git commit -m "Description of your changes"`

#### Submitting a Pull Request

### Development

- Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

- Install pre-commit

```
brew install pre-commit
```

- Run the following command at the root (where mint.json is)

```
mintlify dev
```

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`

• Ensure no broken links by installing pre-commit
