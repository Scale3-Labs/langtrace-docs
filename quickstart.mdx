### Langtrace Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

To use the managed SaaS version of Langtrace, follow the steps below:

1. Sign up by going to [this link](https://langtrace.ai/signup).
2. Create a new Project after signing up. Projects are containers for storing traces and metrics generated by your application. If you have only one application, creating 1 project will do.
3. Choose your project type (Typescript or Python) then generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your application with Langtrace Cloud.

   <Tip>
     You may also create new projects and generate API keys for each of them
     later.
   </Tip>
4. In your application, install the Langtrace SDK and initialize it with the API key you generated in the step 3. The code for installing and setting up the SDK is shown below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Typescript
  // Install the SDK
  npm i @langtrase/typescript-sdk

// Import it into your project. Must precede any llm module imports
import * as Langtrace from '@langtrase/typescript-sdk'

Langtrace.init({ api_key: '<LANGTRACE_API_KEY>'})

````

```python Python
# Install the SDK
pip install langtrace-python-sdk

# Import it into your project. Must precede any llm module imports
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace

# LANGTRACE_API_KEY as an ENVIRONMENT variable
langtrace.init() 
````

</CodeGroup>

You can now start shipping traces to Langtrace Cloud. üöÄ
