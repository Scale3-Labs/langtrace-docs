### Step 2: Configure Authentication

When deploying the template, you'll need to set up authentication for your Langtrace instance:

- Click "_Configure_" on the `langtrace-client` service.
- Add the following authentication-related environment variables:
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Your desired admin email
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Your desired admin password
- For additional authentication methods (e.g., Google OAuth, Azure AD), you can add the necessary environment variables here as well. Refer to our [Authentication](/hosting/auth) guide for detailed instructions on configuring other authentication methods.
- Click "_Save Config_" **→** "_Deploy_".

### Step 3. Deploy the Template

- Click on the “_Deploy Now_” button.
- Click “_Configure_” on `langtrace-client` service and add admin email and admin password and click “_Save Config_” **→** “_Deploy_”.

### Step 4. Access Langtrace

- Once you start the deployment process, it may take around two minutes for Railway to bring up the services.

  > If you want you can check the deploy logs of a particular service by clicking on the service and click “_View Logs_” under the Deployments tab.
