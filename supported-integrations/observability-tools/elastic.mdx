## Overview

Elastic APM is a powerful solution for monitoring the performance of your applications. As Elastic APM is OpenTelemetry (OTel) compatible by default, you will only need to set the following environment variables to start tracing.

<Note>
  We Support all opentelemetry environment variables as well e.g:
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`.
</Note>

```bash
export LANGTRACE_API_HOST="<https://your-elastic-apm-endpoint:443/v1/traces>"
export LANGTRACE_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-elastic-apm-token"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=your-elastic-service
```

### Initialize the Langtrace SDK

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init()

# rest of your code
```

# **Troubleshooting**

â€¢ **Traces not visible in Elastic APM**:

- Ensure that all required environment variables are set correctly. Double-check the variable names and values.
- Also ensure that your `LANGTRACE_API_HOST` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is correct. You need to add `/v1/traces` at the end of your endpoint.
