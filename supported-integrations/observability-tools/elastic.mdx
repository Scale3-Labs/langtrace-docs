## Overview

Elastic APM is a powerful solution for monitoring the performance of your applications. As Elastic APM is OpenTelemetry (OTel) compatible by default, you can easily integrate it with Langtrace to monitor your LLM applications.

## Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables to enable OpenTelemetry tracing and send traces to Elastic APM:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://abcd1234.apm.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443"  # Your Elastic OTEL endpoint
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <secret>"
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=rag-app-demo,service.version=0.0.1,deployment.environment=production"
```

<Note>
  We support all OpenTelemetry environment variables. You can also use the legacy format:
  ```bash
  export LANGTRACE_API_HOST="<https://your-elastic-apm-endpoint:443/v1/traces>"
  export LANGTRACE_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-elastic-apm-token"
  export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=your-elastic-service
  ```
</Note>

<Note>
  For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, both `grpc` and `http` protocols are supported. Choose the one that best fits your infrastructure setup.
</Note>

## Monitoring in Elastic APM

After setting up your application, you can monitor your RAG application's performance in the Elastic APM dashboard. The interface provides deep insights into your application's behavior:
