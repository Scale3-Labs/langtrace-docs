## Overview

Elastic APM is a powerful solution for monitoring the performance of your applications. As Elastic APM is OpenTelemetry (OTel) compatible by default, you can easily integrate it with Langtrace to monitor your LLM applications.

## Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables to enable OpenTelemetry tracing and send traces to Elastic APM:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="abcd1234.apm.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:443"  # Your Elastic OTEL endpoint
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <secret>"
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=rag-app-demo,service.version=0.0.1,deployment.environment=production"
```

<Note>
  We support all OpenTelemetry environment variables. You can also use the legacy format:
  ```bash
  export LANGTRACE_API_HOST="<https://your-elastic-apm-endpoint:443/v1/traces>"
  export LANGTRACE_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-elastic-apm-token"
  export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=your-elastic-service
  ```
</Note>

## RAG Application Example

Here's an example of monitoring a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot application that uses Elastic Search for document search and Azure OpenAI for generating responses.

### Initialize Langtrace

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init()

# Rest of your application code
```

### Configure Azure OpenAI (if using)

Set up the necessary Azure OpenAI environment variables:

```bash
export LLM_TYPE=azure
export OPENAI_VERSION=<version>       # e.g., 2023-05-15
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=<base_url>     # Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<api_key>       # Azure OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_ENGINE=<deployment_name> # Azure deployment name
```

### Monitoring in Elastic APM

After setting up your application, you can monitor your RAG application's performance in the Elastic APM dashboard:

The dashboard provides detailed insights into your application's traces:

You can analyze specific spans and their relationships:

Use these traces for:
- Debugging issues
- Performance monitoring
- System optimization
- Understanding user interactions

## Troubleshooting

• **Traces not visible in Elastic APM**:
- Ensure that all required environment variables are set correctly
- Verify your `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or `LANGTRACE_API_HOST` includes `/v1/traces` at the end
- Check if your authentication token is valid and properly formatted
- Verify your service name is correctly set in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`

• **Missing spans or incomplete traces**:
- Ensure Langtrace is initialized before any LLM operations
- Check if all required dependencies are installed
- Verify your application has proper permissions to send traces
