SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that helps developers monitor their applications and troubleshoot issues. It provides a rich set of features for monitoring and analyzing traces, metrics, and logs.

## Setup

1. Install langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
2. Sign up and start visualizing the traces on [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/)

## Example

Here's a quick experiment for a FastAPI based RAG endpoint built using LangChain.

You can find the sample code in this link:
https://gist.github.com/karthikscale3/c13a5b7c53820ee297badd3acaa26d58

### Steps:

1. Get the SigNoz OTLP endpoint and OTLP header to start sending traces to SigNoz cloud
2. Run the server with the following code.

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=Langtrace \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="<SIGNOZE_OTLP_ENDPOINT>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="<SIGNOZ_OTLP_HEADER>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument uvicorn main:app
```

That's it! ‚ú® üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enjoy the high cardinality traces on SigNoz.
