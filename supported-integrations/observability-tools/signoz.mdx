## Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables to enable OpenTelemetry tracing and send traces to SigNoz:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<token>"
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name="rag chatbot"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="grpc"
```

<Note>
  For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, both `grpc` and `http` protocols are
  supported. Choose the one that best fits your infrastructure setup.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

- **No traces visible**: Verify your SigNoz endpoint and token are correct
- **Missing spans**: Ensure Langtrace is properly initialized before any LLM operations
- **Connection issues**: Check if your OTLP endpoint is accessible from your application

That's it! ‚ú® üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enjoy the high cardinality traces on SigNoz.
