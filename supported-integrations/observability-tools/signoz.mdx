SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that helps developers monitor their applications and troubleshoot issues. It provides a rich set of features for monitoring and analyzing traces, metrics, and logs.

## Setup

1. Install langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
2. Sign up and start visualizing the traces on [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/)

## Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables to enable OpenTelemetry tracing and send traces to SigNoz:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<token>"
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name="rag chatbot"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="grpc"
```

Replace `<token>` with your SigNoz access token.

## RAG Application Example

Here's an example of monitoring a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot application that uses Elastic Search for document search and Azure OpenAI for generating responses.

### Initialize Langtrace

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init()
```

### Configure Azure OpenAI (if using)

Set up the necessary Azure OpenAI environment variables:

```bash
export LLM_TYPE=azure
export OPENAI_VERSION=<version>       # e.g., 2023-05-15
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=<base_url>     # Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<api_key>       # Azure OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_ENGINE=<deployment_name> # Azure deployment name
```

### Running Your Application

For a Flask application, use the OpenTelemetry instrumentation:

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=Langtrace \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="<SIGNOZE_OTLP_ENDPOINT>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="<SIGNOZ_OTLP_HEADER>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument uvicorn main:app
```

### Monitoring in SigNoz

After setting up your application, you can monitor your RAG application's performance in the SigNoz dashboard. The dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your application's behavior:

The main dashboard shows key metrics including:
- Request rates and latency
- Error rates and distribution
- Resource utilization patterns
- Service dependencies

Diving deeper into specific traces reveals detailed execution flows:

The trace view helps you:
- Track request propagation
- Identify bottlenecks
- Measure component-wise latency
- Debug error scenarios

For granular analysis, you can examine individual spans:

The span view provides:
- Detailed timing information
- Input/output parameters
- Error messages and stack traces
- Custom attributes and tags

Use these traces for:
- Debugging issues
- Performance monitoring
- System optimization
- Understanding user interactions

## Troubleshooting

- **No traces visible**: Verify your SigNoz endpoint and token are correct
- **Missing spans**: Ensure Langtrace is properly initialized before any LLM operations
- **Connection issues**: Check if your OTLP endpoint is accessible from your application

That's it! ‚ú® üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enjoy the high cardinality traces on SigNoz.
