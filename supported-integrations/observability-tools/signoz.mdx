SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that helps developers monitor their applications and troubleshoot issues. It provides a rich set of features for monitoring and analyzing traces, metrics, and logs.

## Setup

1. Install langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
2. Sign up and start visualizing the traces on [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/)

## Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables to enable OpenTelemetry tracing and send traces to SigNoz:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<token>"
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name="rag chatbot"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="grpc"
```

Replace `<token>` with your SigNoz access token.

<Note>
For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, both `grpc` and `http` protocols are supported. Choose the one that best fits your infrastructure setup.
</Note>



## Example Trace View

Once your application is sending traces to SigNoz, you'll be able to view detailed trace information including spans and their durations:

![SigNoz Trace Details](/images/signoz/trace-details.png)

The trace view shows:
- Hierarchical span relationships
- Precise timing information for each operation
- Service names and span details
- Duration measurements in milliseconds

## Troubleshooting

- **No traces visible**: Verify your SigNoz endpoint and token are correct
- **Missing spans**: Ensure Langtrace is properly initialized before any LLM operations
- **Connection issues**: Check if your OTLP endpoint is accessible from your application

That's it! ‚ú® üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enjoy the high cardinality traces on SigNoz.
