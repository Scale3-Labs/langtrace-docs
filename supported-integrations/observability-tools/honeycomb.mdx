## Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables to enable OpenTelemetry tracing and send traces to Honeycomb:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.honeycomb.io"
#export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.eu1.honeycomb.io" # EU instance
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=<your-api-key>"

```

<Note>
  The Honeycomb API key should have the necessary permissions to create datasets
  and ingest traces{" "}
</Note>

**Additional Honeycomb Configuration**

For more advanced configuration options or to send data using Go, Typescript and other languages, please refer to the Honeycomb documentation:
