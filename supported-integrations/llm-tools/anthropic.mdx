Using Langtrace to monitor your Claude backed LLM apps is quick and easy. Follow these steps:

## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.

Note: You will also sign up and get an API key from ANTHROPIC if you haven't done so already

2. Install packages and setup environment:

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk anthropic
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Langtrace with Anthropic:

```python Python
# Imports import os
os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'] = 'YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY'
os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] = 'YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'
```

Imports

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace # Must precede any llm module imports
langtrace.init(api_key = os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic(
  # This is the default and can be omitted
  api_key=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
)
```

    </CodeGroup>

Create an Index and upsert some data in Anthropic:

<CodeGroup>
     ```bash Python
message = client.messages.create(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, Claude",
        }
    ],
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
)
print(message)
 ```

</CodeGroup>

You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard
