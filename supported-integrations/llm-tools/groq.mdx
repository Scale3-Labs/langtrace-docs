Using Langtrace to monitor your Groq apps is quick and easy. Follow these steps:

## Setup

1. Install the Langtrace and Groq SDKs.

*Note: You'll need API keys from Langtrace and Groq. Sign up for [Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai) and/or [Groq](https://groq.com/) if you haven't done so already.*

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk groq
```

2. Setup environment variables:

```bash Shell
export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY
export GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
```

## Usage

Generate a simple output with your deployment's model:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import os
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace # Must precede any llm module imports
langtrace.init(api_key = os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])
from groq import Groq
client = Groq(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"],
)

# Generate a simple output with the llama3 MODEL
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is LangChain?",
        }
    ],
    model="llama3-8b-8192",
)
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

    </CodeGroup>

You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard:
