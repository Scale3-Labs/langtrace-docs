# CrewAI Integration

This guide explains how to integrate Langtrace with CrewAI, particularly when using CrewAI's command-line interface.

## Installation Requirements

When using CrewAI's CLI (e.g., when you create a project using `crewai create crew <crewname>`), you need to add Langtrace as a dependency in your project's `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # ... other dependencies ...
    "langtrace_python_sdk>=3.3"
]
```

## Usage

After adding the dependency, you can import and initialize Langtrace in your CrewAI project:

<Note>
    You must initialize Langtrace before importing CrewAI. If you initialize Langtrace after importing CrewAI, it will fail.
</Note>

```python
import os
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace  # Must precede any llm module imports

langtrace.init(api_key=os.environ.get("LANGTRACE_API_KEY"))

# Your CrewAI code here
```

Make sure to set your `LANGTRACE_API_KEY` in your environment variables or `.env` file.

## Running Your CrewAI Project

Once you've added Langtrace as a dependency and initialized it in your code, you can run your CrewAI project normally using the CLI:

```bash
crewai flow kickoff
```

This will now work with Langtrace integration enabled, allowing you to track and monitor your CrewAI agents' interactions.
