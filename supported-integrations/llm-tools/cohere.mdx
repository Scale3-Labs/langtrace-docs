Using Langtrace to monitor your Cohere backed LLM apps is quick and easy. Follow these steps:

## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.

Note: You will also sign up and get an API key from COHERE [initialize](https://cohere.com/) if you haven't done so already

2. Install packages and setup environment:

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk cohere
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Langtrace with Cohere:

```python Python
# Imports import os

import os
os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY"

os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"
```

Imports

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
 from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace # Must precede any llm module imports
langtrace.init(api_key = os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])
import cohere

co = cohere.Client(
api_key=os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'],
)

````

    </CodeGroup>

4. Lets query Cohere's command model:

<CodeGroup>
     ```bash Python
chat = co.chat(
    message="What is Langchain?",
    model="command"
)
print(chat.text)
````

</CodeGroup>

You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard:
