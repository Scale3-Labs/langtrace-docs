CrewAI is an innovative, open-source framework that revolutionizes the way AI agents work together. By orchestrating role-playing, autonomous agents, CrewAI enables the creation of sophisticated multi-agent systems that can tackle complex tasks with ease.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
2. Install CrewAI's SDK and [initialize](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Installing-CrewAI/) the SDK in your code.

### Additional Setup for CrewAI CLI Projects

When using CrewAI's CLI (e.g., when you create a project using `crewai create crew <crewname>`), you need to add Langtrace as a dependency in your project's `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    # ... other dependencies ...
    "langtrace_python_sdk>=3.3"
]
```

### Usage

Use the `langtrace` SDK to capture traces from your CrewAI agents.
