OpenAI Agents SDK is a powerful framework for building AI agents that can interact with tools and APIs. Langtrace now provides native integration with OpenAI Agents SDK, offering full OpenTelemetry (OTEL) compatibility for comprehensive tracing and monitoring of your AI agents.

## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.

*Note: You'll need API key from Langtrace. Sign up for [Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai) if you haven't done so already.*

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk openai
```

2. Setup environment variables:
```bash Shell
export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Langtrace with OpenAI Agents SDK:

```python Python
import os
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace  # Must precede any llm module imports
langtrace.init(api_key=os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])

from openai import OpenAI
from openai.types.beta.agent import Agent

client = OpenAI()

# Create an agent
agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    name="Customer Support Agent",
    description="You are a customer support agent for a clothing retailer.",
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="You are a customer support agent for a clothing retailer. Be friendly and helpful.",
)

# Create a thread
thread = client.beta.threads.create()

# Add a message to the thread
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="I need help finding a shirt in my size.",
)

# Run the agent
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id=agent.id,
)

# Wait for the run to complete
while run.status in ["queued", "in_progress"]:
    run = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(
        thread_id=thread.id,
        run_id=run.id,
    )

# Get the messages
messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(
    thread_id=thread.id,
)

# Print the assistant's response
for message in messages.data:
    if message.role == "assistant":
        print(message.content[0].text.value)
```

You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard, with full OTEL compatibility.
