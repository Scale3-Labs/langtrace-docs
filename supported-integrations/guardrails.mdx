# Langtrace Integration with Guardrails AI

We are excited to announce that Langtrace now supports tracing [Guardrails AI](https://www.guardrailsai.com/) natively. This means Langtrace will automatically capture traces from guardrails with useful information related to the validators and validator metadata and surface it on Langtrace. This helps you get visibility into your models performance based on the validators you are using and the corresponding hits Guardrails is capturing.

## Setup

1. Sign up to Langtrace, create a project and get a Langtrace API key

2. Install Langtrace SDK
```bash
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk
```

3. Setup the .env var
```bash
export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY
```

4. Initialize Langtrace in your code
```python
import os
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
from guardrails.hub import ProfanityFree, ToxicLanguage

langtrace.init()

guard = Guard()
guard.name = 'ChatBotGuard'
guard.use_many(
    ProfanityFree(on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION),
    ToxicLanguage(on_fail="exception"),
    on="output"
)

result = guard(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}],
    model="gpt-4",
    stream=False,
)
```

5. See the traces in Langtrace
