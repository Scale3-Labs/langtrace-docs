Milvus is a cloud-native vector database designed for managing large-scale vector data, powering various AI applications from similarity search to recommendation systems.

## Setup

1. Install Milvus by following the [official installation guide](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md).

2. Create a database and collection in Milvus for your vector data.

3. Install Langtrace and Milvus Python SDK:

```bash
pip install langtrace-python-sdk pymilvus python-dotenv
```

<Note>You'll need an API key from Langtrace. Sign up for [Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai) if you haven't done so already.</Note>

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use Langtrace with Milvus for vector operations:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient, model
from typing import List
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace, with_langtrace_root_span
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
langtrace.init()

client = MilvusClient("milvus_demo.db")

COLLECTION_NAME = "demo_collection"
embedding_fn = model.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()


def create_collection(collection_name: str = COLLECTION_NAME):
    """Creates a new collection in Milvus."""
    if client.has_collection(collection_name=collection_name):
        client.drop_collection(collection_name=collection_name)

    client.create_collection(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        dimension=768,  # The vectors we will use in this demo has 768 dimensions
    )


def create_embedding(docs: List[str] = [], subject: str = "history"):
    """Create embeddings for the given documents."""
    vectors = embedding_fn.encode_documents(docs)
    data = [
        {"id": i, "vector": vectors[i], "text": docs[i], "subject": subject}
        for i in range(len(vectors))
    ]
    return data


def insert_data(collection_name: str = COLLECTION_NAME, data: List[dict] = []):
    """Insert data into the Milvus collection."""
    client.insert(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        data=data,
    )


def vector_search(collection_name: str = COLLECTION_NAME, queries: List[str] = []):
    """Perform vector similarity search."""
    query_vectors = embedding_fn.encode_queries(queries)

    res = client.search(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        data=query_vectors,
        limit=2,
        output_fields=["text", "subject"],
        timeout=10,
        partition_names=["history"],
        anns_field="vector",
        search_params={"nprobe": 10},
    )


def query(collection_name: str = COLLECTION_NAME, query: str = ""):
    """Execute a metadata query on the collection."""
    res = client.query(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        filter=query,
        output_fields=["text", "subject"],
    )


@with_langtrace_root_span("milvus_example")
def main():
    # Initialize collection
    create_collection()

    # Insert historical data
    turing_data = create_embedding(
        docs=[
            "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.",
            "Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in AI.",
            "Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England.",
        ]
    )
    insert_data(data=turing_data)

    # Insert scientific data
    drug_data = create_embedding(
        docs=[
            "Machine learning has been used for drug design.",
            "Computational synthesis with AI algorithms predicts molecular properties.",
            "DDR1 is involved in cancers and fibrosis.",
        ],
        subject="biology",
    )
    insert_data(data=drug_data)

    # Perform vector search and metadata queries
    vector_search(queries=["Who is Alan Turing?"])
    query(query="subject == 'history'")
    query(query="subject == 'biology'")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)
    finally:
        client.close()
```
</CodeGroup>

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Create a collection in Milvus
2. Generate and insert vector embeddings
3. Perform vector similarity search
4. Execute metadata queries
5. Use Langtrace to monitor and trace all vector operations

Each operation is wrapped with Langtrace's tracing capabilities, allowing you to monitor and debug your vector database operations effectively.
