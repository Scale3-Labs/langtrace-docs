## Prerequisites

Before integrating Langtrace with Qdrant, ensure you have the following:

- Qdrant client library installed
- Langtrace Python SDK installed

## Installation

If you haven't already installed the required libraries, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install qdrant-client langtrace-python-sdk
```

## Basic Setup

To start using Langtrace with Qdrant, you need to initialize both clients:

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace, with_langtrace_root_span
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

# Initialize Qdrant client
qdrant_client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)

# Initialize Langtrace
langtrace.init(api_key='your_langtrace_api_key_here')
```

## Tracing Qdrant Operations

Langtrace allows you to trace various Qdrant operations. Here are some common operations and how to trace them:

### Adding Points to a Collection

```python
@with_langtrace_root_span("add_points")
def add_points_to_collection(collection_name, points):
    qdrant_client.upsert(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        points=points
    )
```

### Searching in a Collection

```python
@with_langtrace_root_span("search")
def search_collection(collection_name, query_vector, limit=10):
    return qdrant_client.search(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        query_vector=query_vector,
        limit=limit
    )
```

### Creating a Collection

```python
@with_langtrace_root_span("create_collection")
def create_collection(collection_name, vector_size):
    qdrant_client.recreate_collection(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=vector_size, distance=models.Distance.COSINE)
    )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Span Names**: Choose descriptive names for your spans to easily identify operations in the Langtrace dashboard.

2. **Error Handling**: Wrap your Qdrant operations in try-except blocks to capture and trace errors:

   ```python
   @with_langtrace_root_span("qdrant_operation")
   def qdrant_operation():
       try:
           # Qdrant operation here
           pass
       except Exception as e:
           add_attribute_to_current_span("error", str(e))
           raise
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Use Langtrace to monitor the performance of your Qdrant operations over time. This can help you identify slow queries or other bottlenecks in your application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Langtrace and Qdrant integration, consider the following:

1. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that both Qdrant and Langtrace servers are accessible from your application.

2. **Verify API Keys**: Double-check that you're using the correct Langtrace API key.

3. **Update Libraries**: Ensure you're using the latest versions of both the Qdrant client and Langtrace SDK.
