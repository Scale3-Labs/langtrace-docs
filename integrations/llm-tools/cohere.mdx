Using Langtrace to monitor your Cohere backed LLM apps is quick and easy. Follow these steps:

## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.

*Note: You'll need API keys from Langtrace and Cohere. Sign up for [Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai) and/or [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) if you haven't done so already.*

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk cohere
```

2. Setup environment variables:

```bash Shell
export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY
export COHERE_API_KEY=YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY
```

## Usage

Generate a simple output with your deployment's model:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Imports import os
import os
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace # Must precede any llm module imports
langtrace.init(api_key = os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])
import cohere
co = cohere.Client(
    api_key=os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'],
)

#  Lets query Cohere's command model
chat = co.chat(
    message="What is Langchain?",
    model="command"
)
print(chat.text)
```
</CodeGroup>

You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard:
