## Setup

> The following steps are for development purpose only and serves as a reference for production usecases. If you wish to setup production, make sure to scale the resources accordingly.

### Step 1: Clone and update configuration

#### Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-azure-setup.git
cd langtrace-azure-setup
```

#### Update default variables (recommended)

Update the region and username and passwords of the admin user and Postgres DB based on your preference in the file `main.tfvars.json`.
You can also modify `variables.tf` based on your setup requirements.

### Step 2. Run theÂ Deploy

Run the following command to initiate the deploy process

```bash
azd up
```

Now you will be asked to input the following variables. Give a unique name for langtrace_project as it would be part of the self-hosted langtrace app URL.

### Step 3. Access the Langtrace app

Once you have provided the inputs, the deployment process will take about 15 minutes to provision all the resources. Once the deployment is successful, you will see the output with a URL as below.

```bash
Outputs:

langtrace_url = "https://langtraceblog-app.azurewebsites.net"
```

Open the URL and login using admin credentials. Admin credentials are in the file `main.tfvars.json` under the key `admin_email` and `admin_password`.

You can now start using Langtrace in your application! ðŸŽ‰

## Cleanup

To cleanup the resources, run the following command

```bash
azd down
```

> While running this command, you will be asked for variables, you can enter anything or keep it blank.

Within five minutes, all the resources will be deleted from your Azure account.

## Troubleshooting

 <Accordion title="Login page does not load">
    If you have freshly setup the app, please wait for 15-20 minutes for the app to be fully ready. Sometimes Azure app service takes a while to start the app. You can check the deployment logs by going to "Deployment Center" > "Logs" in the Azure portal.
    You can also [contact us](/contact/contact-us) or create an issue on [langtrace-azure-setup](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-azure-setup) if the issue still persists.
