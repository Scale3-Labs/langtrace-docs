## Self-hosting Langtrace

To run Langtrace locally, you have to run three services:

- Next.js app
- Postgres database
- Clickhouse database

### Configure Langtrace SDK

To configure the Langtrace SDK for self-hosted setups, checkout the guide [here](/hosting/using_local_setup).

### Authentication Setup

Langtrace supports multiple authentication methods, including Admin Password, Google OAuth, and Azure AD OAuth. For detailed instructions on configuring authentication for your self-hosted setup, refer to our [Authentication](/hosting/auth) guide.
