## How to run evaluations

Langtrace relies on [Inspect AI](https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_ai/), an Open Source framework for large language model evaluations created by the [UK AI Safety Institute](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ai-safety-institute-releases-new-ai-safety-evaluations-platform). You can run evaluations on annotated datasets as well as your own datasets.

Inspect provides many built-in components, including facilities for prompt engineering, tool usage, multi-turn dialog, and model graded evaluations. Extensions to Inspect (e.g. to support new elicitation and scoring techniques) can be provided by other Python packages.

In order to run evaluations, you need to have a dataset that has been annotated with Langtrace. To annotate a dataset, you can follow the steps in the [Annotate & Measure](/features/annotations) guide. Once you have an annotated dataset, follow the steps below to run evaluations.

1. Install Langtrace SDK & Inspect AI

```
pip install langtrace-python-sdk
pip install inspect-ai
```

2. Make sure you add the LANGTRACE_API_KEY to your environment variables as shown below. **Note**: If you don't have an API key, you can generate one by following the steps in the [Generate API Key](/quickstart) guide.

```bash
export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=<your-api-key
```

**Note**: If you are self-hosting, set the LANGTRACE_API_HOST environment variable to the URL of your Langtrace instance.

```bash
export LANGTRACE_API_HOST=<your-langtrace-instance-url>
```

3. Copy the dataset ID from Langtrace and replace `<datasetId>` in the script below

4. Write a simple evaluation script and save it in a file called `example_eval.py`

```python
from inspect_ai import Task, task
from inspect_ai.dataset import csv_dataset
from inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_qa
from inspect_ai.solver import chain_of_thought, self_critique

@task
def example_eval():
    return Task(
        dataset=csv_dataset("langtracefs://<datasetId>"),
        plan=[
            chain_of_thought(),
            self_critique()
        ],
        scorer=model_graded_qa()
    )

```

5. Run the evaluation script

```bash
inspect eval example_eval.py --model openai/gpt-3.5-turbo --log-dir langtracefs://<datasetId>
```

6. Additionally, you can also configure the `--log-dir` as an environment variable as shown below:

```bash
INSPECT_LOG_DIR=langtracefs://<datasetId>
```

Additional options for configuring your environment can be found in the [Inspect AI documentation](https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_ai/workflow.html#sec-workflow-configuration).

7. If you want to run evaluations on your own datasets, you can set up your evaluation script as shown below:

```python
from inspect_ai import Task, task
from inspect_ai.dataset import csv_dataset
from inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_qa
from inspect_ai.solver import chain_of_thought, self_critique

@task
def example_eval():
    return Task(
        dataset=csv_dataset("./path/to/your/dataset.csv"),
        plan=[
            chain_of_thought(),
            self_critique()
        ],
        scorer=model_graded_qa()
    )

```

8. And, run the evaluation script by simply passing `langtracefs://` to the `--log-dir` flag.

```bash
inspect eval example_eval.py --model openai/gpt-3.5-turbo --log-dir langtracefs://
```

9. Now, go to the Evaluations tab in the Langtrace dashboard to view the evaluation results.

10. Additionally, inspect has a built-in web interface that you can use to view the evaluation results. It works inside VSCode as well as on the browser. You can access the web interface by running the following command:

```bash
inspect view --log-dir langtracefs://<datasetId>
```
