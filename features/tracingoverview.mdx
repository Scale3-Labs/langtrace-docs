## What is Tracing?

In the context of Langtrace, tracing refers to the process of capturing detailed information about the execution of your LLM apps. This includes data such as:

- Input and output tokens
- Response times
- Model parameters
- User feedback
- Custom attributes

## Core Components

### SDK

The Langtrace SDK is the primary tool for implementing tracing in your application. It:

- Integrates easily with your existing codebase
- Collects traces automatically
- Allows for custom attribute tracking

### Dashboard

The Langtrace Dashboard provides a web interface for:

- Visualizing collected traces
- Analyzing performance metrics
- Identifying trends and anomalies

## Next Steps

The following sections will dive deeper into specific tracing features and provide implementation guides for various use cases.
