## What is a Root Span?

A root span is the top-level span in a trace that encompasses all related operations. It provides a hierarchical structure to your traces, making it easier to understand the relationship between different operations in your application.

## Benefits of Grouping Traces

- Improved Visibility: See the entire flow of operations in a single trace.
- Performance Analysis: Easily identify bottlenecks within a group of related operations.
- Debugging: Quickly pinpoint issues within a specific workflow.
- Context Preservation: Maintain context across multiple operations, making it easier to understand the full picture of your application's behavior.

## How to Group Traces

A typical application may have multiple operations that are related to each other. For example, in a RAG workflow, the user's input is embedded using a model, a semantic search is done on a VectorDB, and the results are again given back to the model to get a natural language response. In such cases, it is useful to group these operations together under a single root span. This allows you to see the entire flow of operations in a single trace.

### Installation

Step 1: Install and initialize Langtrace SDK. Refer to the [installation guide](/quickstart) for more information.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
// Must precede any llm module imports
import * as Langtrace from "@langtrase/typescript-sdk";
Langtrace.init({ api_key: LANGTRACE_API_KEY });
```

```python Python
# Must precede any llm module imports
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init(api_key = '<LANGTRACE_API_KEY>')
```

</CodeGroup>

### Usage

Step 2: Use the `with_langtrace_root_span` decorator (Python) or `WithLangTraceRootSpan` (Typescript) function. Example below:

### Usage Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to group traces in a typical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow:

1. Embed user input
2. Perform semantic search on a vector database
3. Generate a response using an LLM

### Examples

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript
import * as Langtrace from "@langtrase/typescript-sdk";

export async function chatResponse(): Promise<void> {
  await Langtrace.withLangTraceRootSpan(async () => {
    const client = new ChromaClient();
    const collection = await client.getCollection({
      name: "documentation",
      embeddingFunction: embedder,
    });

    const results = await collection.query({
      nResults: 2,
      queryTexts: ["How to setup Langtrace?"],
    });

    const openaiclient = new OpenAI();
    return openaiclient.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: `Respond in a natural language: ${results}`,
        },
      ],
      stream: false,
    });

});
}

````
```python Python
import chromadb
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
from langtrace_python_sdk.utils.with_root_span import with_langtrace_root_span
from openai import OpenAI

langtrace.init()

@with_langtrace_root_span()
def example():

    client = chromadb.HttpClient()
    collection = client.get_collection("sample_collection")
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=['How to setup Langtrace?'],
        n_results=2,
    )
    openai_client = OpenAI()
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, how to setup Langtrace?"}],
        stream=False,
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

## Best Practices for Grouping Traces

1. Group Logically: Create root spans around logical units of work or user-facing operations.
2. Keep it Simple: Avoid creating overly complex hierarchies of spans.
3. Use Consistent Naming: Adopt a consistent naming convention for your root spans to make analysis easier.
4. Add Context: Use attributes to add relevant context to your root spans.
5. Balance Detail and Overview: Strive for a balance between providing detailed traces and maintaining a clear high-level view of your application's behavior.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing grouped traces as expected:

1. Verify that Langtrace is properly initialized before any LLM module imports.
2. Ensure that all relevant operations are within the scope of the `withLangTraceRootSpan` function or `@with_langtrace_root_span` decorator.
3. Check that your API key is correct and that you have the necessary permissions.
4. If using asynchronous operations, make sure they're properly awaited within the root span scope.
