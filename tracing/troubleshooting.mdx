# Trace Ingestion Issues

## Checking Trace Status

When sending traces to Langtrace, you can verify successful ingestion through multiple steps:

1. **UI Dashboard**: Check the Traces tab in your project dashboard
2. **Collector Logs**: Verify traces are reaching the collector
3. **Backend Logs**: Confirm successful POST requests to `/api/traces`

## Common Issues

### Traces Not Appearing in UI

If traces are not appearing in the UI but you see successful POST requests:

1. **Check Database Configuration**:
   - Ensure ClickHouse is properly configured
   - Verify database and table schemas are created
   - Check database connection settings

2. **Verify Project Configuration**:
   - Confirm project ID in collector configuration
   - Validate API key usage in SDK initialization

3. **Inspect Trace Data**:
   - Check trace attributes format
   - Verify span relationships (parent-child)
   - Ensure required fields are present

### SDK Configuration

When configuring the Python SDK, ensure proper endpoint configuration:

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# Configure OTLP exporter
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",  # Use appropriate host/port
    headers=(("Content-Type", "application/json"),)
)

# Initialize Langtrace
langtrace.init(
    api_key='your_api_key',
    custom_remote_exporter=otlp_exporter,
    batch=False  # Set to True for production
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Use `batch=False` for immediate trace visibility
   - Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
   - Monitor collector and service logs

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Enable batch processing for better performance
   - Configure appropriate TTL for traces
   - Monitor trace storage usage
