## What is a Session ID?

A session ID is a unique identifier for a user session. It is useful to group traces together for a single user session.

## How to pass a session ID to traces

In order to pass a session ID to traces, you can use the `inject_additional_attributes` function (Python) or `withAdditionalAttributes` function (Typescript).

## Usage

For python, you can use the `inject_additional_attributes` function to pass a session ID to traces.

```python
from langtrace.utils import inject_additional_attributes

inject_additional_attributes(lambda: None, {"session.id": "unique-session-id"})
```

For Typescript, you can use the `withAdditionalAttributes` function to pass a session ID to traces.

```typescript
withAdditionalAttributes(async () => {
    // your code here
}, { "session.id": "unique-session-id" });
```

## How to filter traces by session ID

To filter traces by session ID, you can use the `session.id` filter in the UI. Additionally, you can also see the session ID of each trace in the UI.
