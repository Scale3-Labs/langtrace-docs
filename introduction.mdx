Using Langtrace open-source observability tool, you can simply collect and analyze traces to help you improve your LLM apps. Langtrace supports OpenTelemetry. You can choose to export the traces to Langtrace, or to your existing observability stack.

We provide insights into the following 3 pillars of observability for your LLM apps:

- Accuracy
- Latency
- Performance

## Setting up

The first step to using Langtrace is to import into your Typescript or Python project.

#### Step 1: Generate an API key from the Langtrace AI dashboard.

- Go to the [Langtrace Cloud dashboard](https://langtrace.ai/projects)
- Create a new project, be sure to provide a name and description
  ![project](/images/SCR-20240402-kzzp-2.png)

- Click on the Project name
- Click on the `Generate API Key` button
  ![api](/images/SCR-20240402-lblq-2.png)

- Copy the generated API key. You will need this key to initialize the SDK in your project.

#### Step 2: Install the SDK on your project:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
import { init } from "@langtrace-init/init";

init({ api_key: LANGTRACE_API_KEY });
```

```python Python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace

langtrace.init(api_key=LANGTRACE_API_KEY)
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Step 3: Review your traces on the Langtrace dashboard.

You can now view your traces on the [Langtrace dashboard](https://langtrace.ai/projects).
