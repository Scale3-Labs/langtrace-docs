[Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai/) is an open-source observability tool that collects and analyze traces in order to help you improve your LLM apps. Langtrace has two components:

- **SDK**: The SDK is a lightweight library that can be installed and imported into your project in order to collect traces. The [traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) are [open telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) based and can be exported to Langtrace or any other observability stack (Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb etc) without having to use a Langtrace API key. 
  <br />
  **GitHub**: [`Python SDK`](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-python-sdk)
  [`Typescript SDK`](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-typescript-sdk) [`trace-attributes`](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-trace-attributes)
- **Langtrace Dashboard**: The dashboard is a web-based interface where you can view and analyze your traces.

<Note>
	**[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)**: The traces generated by
	Langtrace are based on the OpenTelemetry standard. This means that you can use
	Langtrace with your existing observability stack (No Langtrace API key required.), or export the traces to
	Langtrace.

Langtrace optimizes for the following 3 pillars of observability for your LLM apps:

- Usage - Tokens and Cost
- Accuracy
- Performance - Latency and Success Rate

## Setting up

The first step to using Langtrace is to import into your Typescript or Python project.

#### Step 1: Signup to Langtrace and generate an API key from the Langtrace dashboard.

- Signup to Langtrace [here](https://langtrace.ai/signup)
- Go to the [Langtrace dashboard](https://langtrace.ai/projects)
- Create a new project, be sure to provide a name and description
  ![project](/images/SCR-20240402-kzzp-2.png)

- Click on the Project name
- Click on the `Generate API Key` button
  ![api](/images/SCR-20240402-lblq-2.png)

- Copy the generated API key. You will need this key to initialize the SDK in your project.

#### Step 2: Install the SDK on your project:

- **Python**: Install the Langtrace SDK using pip

```python
pip install langtrace-python-sdk
```

- **Typescript**: Install the Langtrace SDK using npm

```typescript
npm i @langtrase/typescript-sdk
```

#### Step 3: Initialize the SDK in your project:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript
// Must precede any llm module imports
import * as Langtrace from "@langtrase/typescript-sdk";

Langtrace.init({ api_key: "<LANGTRACE_API_KEY>" });
```

```python Python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace

langtrace.init(api_key = '<LANGTRACE_API_KEY>')
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Step 3: Run your application to view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard.

You can now view your traces on the [Langtrace dashboard](https://langtrace.ai/projects).
